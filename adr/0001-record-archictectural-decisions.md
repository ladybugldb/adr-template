# 1. Record architectural decisions

Date: 06/02/2017

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. We do not want documentation to be a significant burden for developers, but at the same time we want to ensure that:

- Architectural decisions are articulated properly and are discussed in detail before implementing them
- Decisions are easily accessible for the whole team, including remote offices
- There is enough information for a newly involved developer to have a high-level overview about the project
- There is a record _why_ a certain decision was made, so that it can be revised later.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
