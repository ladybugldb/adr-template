# Architecture Decision Records

This repository contains a log of architectural decisions made for the Watson for Media project, and some reference documents that are relevent for all teams. For more information about ADRs see [Michael Nygard's article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
